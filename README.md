Zipcode Lookup

This little app uses Gunicorn for launch a Flask app, styled with Bootstrap, that runs a Python code that looks up that user entered zip code, then checks with the Census site to match that zip code to a city / town / village, county & state, then provide that to the user. It is made for fun and as a way to prove out how to make a very simple app with these tools.
